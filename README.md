# Calorie Calculator

... WIP .. IN THE MAKING ...

The intention is that this will be a calorie calculator based off of food
information from Livsmedelsverket _(Swedish eqivalence of FDA in the U.S.A)_.

In the long run this might also support importing food info data from other
sources, since most countries have open data for stuff like this.

And do I know that the KDE desktop has an application named Kcalc? Yes I do!
